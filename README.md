# OpenCL-SDK (in development)

This is the Khronos OpenCL SDK. It brings together all the components needed to
develop OpenCL applications:

- OpenCL Headers (`include/api`)
- OpenCL C++ bindings (`include/cpp`)
- OpenCL Loader
- OpenCL utility library (`include/utils`)

It also contains resources useful to OpenCL developers:

- Code samples (`samples/`)
- Documentation (`docs/`)

## Setting Up the SDK

This repository uses sub-modules for the OpenCL Headers, OpenCL C++ bindings, and OpenCL ICD Loader.

To clone a new repository with all sub-modules included, use the `--recursive` option.
Note that this option clones all sub-modules and their dependencies, which are not required for the OpenCL SDK:

```sh
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/KhronosGroup/OpenCL-SDK.git
```

Alternatively, to clone only the sub-modules for the OpenCL SDK, first clone this repository without sub-modules included:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/KhronosGroup/OpenCL-SDK.git
```

Then setup sub-modules:

```sh
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update
```

## Building the Samples

This repository uses CMake as its build system.
The suggested build directory is `build`.

To generate build files, use for example:

```sh
$ mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake ..
```

Then build with the generated build files.
