# Ruby Samples

## Sample Purpose

Those samples reproduce the core samples using Ruby. They accept the same
options, please refer to each core sample `README.md` for documentation.

## Prerequisites

In addition to a working Ruby installation, as well as Ruby development files,
those samples require the `opencl_ruby_ffi` Ruby bindings. The bindings can be
installed using:
```bash
gem install --user-install opencl_ruby_ffi
```
